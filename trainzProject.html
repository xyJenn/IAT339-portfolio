              The team was given a pre-designed game called Ticket to Ride (not Hasbro Ticket to Ride) where we had to redesign and incorporate new game design elements. The concept of the game is that the players will go around the board and collect different types of samples. Players will then have to bring one of each sample back to the train station to win. There is also a card deck which allows the player to perform an action.

            <p>
              When we received the predesigned game, we wanted to make the production mechanism more complicated and for dynamic. Instead of only collecting four different samples, players must collect the correct type of samples that the merchant wants to collect in order to receive points. We also added other economies into the game. The players can collect scraps which either help them increase their process or decrease other players’ process. This creates a more balanced game so that winners will not continue to win and losers will have a chance to catch up. Figure 2 describes how each item can be received in the game.

            <h4 class="subSectionHeading"> Areas of improvement</h4>
            <p>
              We saw two major categories of changes that would greatly improve the state of our game. Firstly and most obviously, balance was an issue. Designing a board game meant that we had a lot of control over how the mechanics worked, without needing to worry about coding and graphics. With freedom to add mechanics comes headaches trying to balance them. We constantly fired ideas back and forth at each other to patch up problems we noticed, but new balancing issues arose.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second major problem was managing randomness. Occasionally, each player had a shot to win the game. Other times, a player would accelerate way past the others, or some players lagged behind dramatically. The randomness in our game is a bit out of control and needs to be toned down in order to tame the player experience. For example, in one game, I had enough resources to perform 10 actions in a turn. My opponent, who wasn’t so lucky, drew over her hand and discarded half her hand. These actions were completely up to luck, and caused her to have a bad experience.

            <p>
              The production of the game was during the pandemic. Creating a game virtually and collaborating with teammates that I’ve never met was a very difficult process. Through the production of this game, I learned that the fun of a board game is not only about the mechanism that it has, but also the balancing of the game. If the production and player balancing is not done correctly, one players may exceed and the game may end quickly. Balancing was also difficult to achieve as we were quarantined and could not test it the way we waned to. Because this is a board game, it may achieve a different interaction if it was played and created in person rather than virtually. </p>

              We learned that making a board game takes patience and a lot of
              testing. You’re going to come up with great ideas, and then you’re
              going to have to get rid of them. There might be some ideas you’re
              not willing to let go of, even when a team member has proposed a
              more functional alternative. We also learned how difficult it was
              to balance. A game that is too simple may lack gameplay dynamics,
              but a game that is sufficiently complex will require lots of
              testing and balancing. This is why, according to veteran game
              designers, board game developers pay top dollar to send their game
              to experienced game testers multiple times to get feedback on
              their game.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 align-self-center">
            <p>
              It was surprisingly easy to get a working prototype into Tabletop
              Simulator. However, we still felt like it was a barrier to testing
              our concepts. We imagine that using placeholder pieces on a board
              drawn on a piece of paper would be an easier way to test primitive
              game concepts before moving forward with them. Additionally, it’s
              easier to convey information on physical cards and surfaces.
              Camera angles and screen resolution posed as problems for
              legibility of written information. It would be easier to convey
              game rules on a physical surface and face-to-face communication.
              Finally, it wasn’t quite as fun to play board games online. The
              social aspect of playing board games in person can’t be replaced
              with virtual experiences (quite yet). We look forward to
              potentially playing some of these games in person when school
              opens up again.
