              The objective of tRAINz is to travel along the tracks and obtain
              ores to trade gems with the merchant. Each gem is worth a
              different number of points. The goal is to trade with the merchant
              and gain 10 points. The first player who reaches 10 points wins.

              People fun after analyzing other family friendly board games like
              the original Ticket to Ride, Monopoly, Clue, and others, we
              concluded that they are relatively neutral in design, with aims to
              appeal to a wide audience.

              We saw two major categories of changes that would greatly improve
              the state of our game. Firstly and most obviously, balance was an
              issue. Designing a board game meant that we had a lot of control
              over how the mechanics worked, without needing to worry about
              coding and graphics. With freedom to add mechanics comes headaches
              trying to balance them. We constantly fired ideas back and forth
              at each other to patch up problems we noticed, but new balancing
              issues arose.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second major problem was managing randomness. Occasionally,
              each player had a shot to win the game. Other times, a player
              would accelerate way past the others, or some players lagged
              behind dramatically. The randomness in our game is a bit out of
              control and needs to be toned down in order to tame the player
              experience. For example, in one game, I had enough resources to
              perform 10 actions in a turn. My opponent, who wasn’t so lucky,
              drew over her hand and discarded half her hand. These actions were
              completely up to luck, and caused her to have a bad experience.

              issues arose. We learned that making a board game takes patience
              and a lot of testing. You’re going to come up with great ideas,
              and then you’re going to have to get rid of them. There might be
              some ideas you’re not willing to let go of, even when a team
              member has proposed a more functional alternative. We also learned
              how difficult it was to balance. A game that is too simple may
              lack gameplay dynamics, but a game that is sufficiently complex
              will require lots of testing and balancing. This is why, according
              to veteran game designers, board game developers pay top dollar to
              send their game to experienced game testers multiple times to get
              feedback on their game.

              It was surprisingly easy to get a working prototype into Tabletop
              Simulator. However, we still felt like it was a barrier to testing
              our concepts. We imagine that using placeholder pieces on a board
              drawn on a piece of paper would be an easier way to test primitive
              game concepts before moving forward with them. Additionally, it’s
              easier to convey information on physical cards and surfaces.
              Camera angles and screen resolution posed as problems for
              legibility of written information. It would be easier to convey
              game rules on a physical surface and face-to-face communication.
              Finally, it wasn’t quite as fun to play board games online. The
              social aspect of playing board games in person can’t be replaced
              with virtual experiences (quite yet). We look forward to
              potentially playing some of these games in person when school
              opens up again.
